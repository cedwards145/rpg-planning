# RPG Planning

## Setting
This game takes place in a magic academy and small town that has grown around
the entrance to the Dungeon. A sprawling landscape full of forests, caves and
mountains, the Dungeon is heavily infused with magic, and it is home to all
kinds of magical creatures, stones and plants.

The school heavily controls access to the Dungeon to protect people venturing
into it. Students of the school earn ranks by taking classes and studying
monsters and skills, and higher ranks are allowed to explore deeper areas of the
Dungeon. As the Dungeon is unique, and the school controls the only known
entrance, many types of people enroll, from aspiring adventurers to experienced
mages and shopkeepers.

The town around the school has grown from a few small stalls selling produce
gather from the Dungeon into a bustling hub where traders and adventurers from
around the world meet to buy and sell treasures from the Dungeon.
