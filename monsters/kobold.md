## Kobold
Kobolds are small creatures that usually live in heavily forested areas. They
form large tribes and are clever enough to use simple tools and weapons. Kobolds
are particularly attracted to shiny objects and are known to attack travelers to
steal attractive items.

### Strengths
Kobolds are relatively weak creatures that rely on numbers to overwhelm
opponents. They often attempt to steal items, and once they are satisfied, they
are extremely adept at escaping.

### Weaknesses
Kobolds have a major weakness to shiny objects. Anything from coins,
semi-precious stones or weapons will satisfy a kobold, and once they obtain
some treasure, they will quickly flee a battle.
