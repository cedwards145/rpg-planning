## Boar
Unlike wild boars found outside the Dungeon, these boars are significantly
larger. They are also incredibly territorial, and will not hesitate to charge
into a fight when they feel threatened.

### Strengths
Their large size and thick skin mean boars are highly resistant to physical
attacks. While they are vulnerable to magic, they do not scare easily like other
animals, and they are remarkably difficult to slay even with magic.

Boars are also incredibly powerful. Despite a lack of magical ability, their
tusks can inflict massive damage if they are allowed to get into close combat.

### Weaknesses
While slaying a boar in combat is difficult, fights can often be avoided. Boars
are territorial, so keeping a safe distance from them is the easiest way to
avoid combat.

If a fight cannot be helped, boars can be soothed or distracted by tempting them
with truffles. Throwing truffles to boars will usually keep a boar busy long
enough to flee the fight.
