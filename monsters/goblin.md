## Goblin
While goblins appear small, they are definitely not harmless. They are quick
to anger, and will form small groups to overwhelm tough enemies. If confronted
with a goblin, it is best to prepare for combat. Once threatened, they will
not back down.

### Strengths
Despite being magical creatures, goblins do not possess enough intelligence to
cast magic. They will usually attack physically, using they teeth, claws or
occasionally improvised tools.

Due to their aggressive nature and large groups, it is very difficult to escape
fights with goblins.

### Weaknesses
Most magic and physical attacks will be effective at slaying goblins.
